['For the pastry, wrap the butter in foil and place in the freezer the night before you need it. Put the ham hocks, bay leaves and peppercorns in a large pan. Cover with water and a lid, and simmer for 3 hrs or until really tender – you may need to top up the water level during cooking. (Alternatively, cook in a slow cooker for 6-8 hrs.)

Add enough of the ham’s cooking liquid to thin the sauce to a double cream consistency, about 300ml.
